Progress summary for GitHub app check (2025-09-29)

Completed
- Searched common install directories (Program Files, Program Files (x86), AppData Local/Programs) and found no folders matching GitHub.
- Ran WMIC uninstall registry query for entries containing "GitHub"; no instances returned.

Pending
- Need to verify VS Code extensions. `code --list-extensions` is unavailable; next step is to locate the VS Code CLI or inspect the extensions folder manually.

Next session notes
- Try running "code" from its installation directory or use `%LocalAppData%\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\bin\code.cmd` if present.
- Alternatively, check `%UserProfile%\.vscode\extensions` for GitHub-related extensions.
