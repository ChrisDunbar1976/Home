Summary

- Claude Code 2.0.0 reinstalled; VS Code now lists only desired extensions.
- Scheduled tasks/services clean; ready to verify in next GUI session.

Completed

- Removed bundled GitHub extension folders from the extracted VS Code archive at C:\Users\cdunbar\Desktop\VSCode-win32-x64-1.104.2\resources\app\extensions.
- Deleted GitHub extension bundles from the portable VS Code archive at C:\Users\cdunbar\Downloads\VSCode-win32-x64-1.104.2\resources\app\extensions.
- Purged stored GitHub credentials via `cmdkey /delete` for git:https://github.com.
- Cleared GitHub Copilot cache under %APPDATA%\Code\User\globalStorage.
- Reinstalled Claude Code extension (anthropic.claude-code-2.0.0) and confirmed the `.vscode\extensions` listing shows only desired extensions.
- Re-ran `Get-ScheduledTask` and `Get-Service` checks; no GitHub-related entries.

Pending
- Validate that VS Code launches with Claude Code active and no GitHub prompts during normal use.
- Monitor for residual GitHub folders that might reappear after future installs or updates.

Next session notes
- On next VS Code launch, confirm Claude Code works and no GitHub extensions auto-install.
