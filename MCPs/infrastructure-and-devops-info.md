- **Monitoring Systems**: Nagios, Prometheus, and other monitoring tools

## Claude Code Configuration

### AWS Infrastructure
```bash
claude mcp add aws \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxx \
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx \
  -- npx -y aws-mcp-server
```

### Azure DevOps
```bash
claude mcp add azure-devops \
  -e ADO_ORGANIZATION="https://dev.azure.com/your-org" \
  -e ADO_PROJECT="your-project" \
  -e ADO_PAT="your-token" \
  -- npx -y @rxreyn3/azure-devops-mcp@latest
```

### Docker Management
```bash
claude mcp add docker -- npx -y docker-mcp-server
```

### Kubernetes Cluster Management
```bash
claude mcp add kubernetes -- npx -y kubectl-mcp-server
```

## Authentication Requirements
- **Cloud Provider Credentials**: API keys, access tokens, or service accounts
- **Cluster Access**: Kubernetes config files or service account tokens
- **Repository Access**: Git credentials or SSH keys for version control
- **Service Tokens**: Build system and monitoring tool authentication

## Available Tools

### Cloud Infrastructure
- **AWS Services**: EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, and other AWS resources
- **Documentation Access**: API references, architectural guidance
- **Resource Management**: Creation, monitoring, and cleanup operations
- **Cost Analysis**: Resource utilization and billing insights

### Container Operations
- **Docker Management**: Image building, container lifecycle, network management
- **Registry Operations**: Push/pull operations, image scanning
- **Compose Support**: Multi-container application management
- **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability assessment for containers

### Kubernetes Administration
- **Cluster Monitoring**: Pod status, node health, service discovery
- **Deployment Management**: Rolling updates, scaling operations
- **Log Analysis**: Container logs and cluster events
- **Resource Management**: CPU, memory, and storage allocation

### Build Pipeline Management
- **Azure DevOps**: Build agent status, queue management, pipeline monitoring
- **CI/CD Operations**: Trigger builds, monitor deployments
- **Artifact Management**: Build outputs and dependency management
- **Test Automation**: Integration with testing frameworks

## Setup Process
1. **Choose Target Platform**: Select cloud provider or DevOps tool
2. **Generate Credentials**: Create API keys, tokens, or service accounts
3. **Install MCP Server**: Add to Claude Code configuration
4. **Configure Authentication**: Set up environment variables
5. **Test Integration**: Verify connection and permissions
6. **Configure Security**: Apply least-privilege access principles

## Example Use Cases
- "Deploy the latest application version to production Kubernetes cluster"
- "Check the status of all Azure DevOps build agents"
- "Create a new AWS Lambda function for data processing"
- "Scale the frontend deployment to handle increased traffic"
- "Analyze Docker container resource usage across the cluster"
- "Set up monitoring for the new microservice deployment"
- "Troubleshoot failed builds in the CI/CD pipeline"
- "Create secure sandbox environment for testing new code"

## Security Features
- **Least Privilege Access**: Minimal required permissions for operations
- **Credential Management**: Secure token and key storage
- **Audit Logging**: Track all operations and changes
- **Sandbox Isolation**: Secure execution environments
- **Network Policies**: Controlled access to infrastructure resources
- **Role-Based Access**: Integration with existing RBAC systems

## Benefits
- **Infrastructure-Aware AI**: Context about your deployment environment
- **Expert System Administration**: Like having a senior sysadmin available 24/7
- **Natural Language Operations**: Manage complex infrastructure through conversation
- **Cross-Platform Management**: Handle multiple cloud providers and tools
- **Reduced Context Switching**: Stay in development flow while managing infrastructure
- **Knowledge Democratization**: Make DevOps expertise accessible to all team members

## Current Limitations
- **Beta Status**: Many implementations are in early development
- **Permission Complexity**: Requires careful credential and access management
- **API Rate Limits**: Cloud provider and tool limitations apply
- **Security Considerations**: Elevated privileges require careful handling
- **Learning Curve**: Understanding integration patterns and best practices

## Prerequisites
- Active accounts with target cloud providers or DevOps platforms
- Appropriate API credentials with necessary permissions
- Claude Code with MCP support
- Network access to target infrastructure and services
- Understanding of security implications for elevated access
