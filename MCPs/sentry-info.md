# Sentry - Error Monitoring & Performance Tracking

Sentry is a developer-focused platform that helps you monitor application errors and performance in real-time. It captures crashes, exceptions, and performance issues across your entire stack.

## Key Features
- **Error tracking**: Automatically captures unhandled exceptions, stack traces, and error context
- **Performance monitoring**: Tracks slow queries, API calls, and page loads
- **Release tracking**: Monitors deployments and correlates issues with releases
- **User impact**: Shows which users are affected by specific errors
- **Integrations**: Works with 100+ platforms (React, Python, Node.js, mobile apps, etc.)

## Why Developers Use It
- Find and fix bugs before users report them
- Get detailed context about when/where errors happen
- Track if new releases introduce problems
- Prioritize fixes based on user impact
- Reduce debugging time with rich error details
