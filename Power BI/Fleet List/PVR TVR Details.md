# PVR/TVR Details Visual Notes

- Header and icons: standard navigation bar, home icon (page navigation) and warning icon linked to the service-desk request template.
- Title textbox identifies the page as "PVR/TVR Details"; background grouping keeps the layout aligned with other pages.
- Depot donut (centre) shows the full 1,732-vehicle fleet split by operating depot; centre label shows the fleet total.
- KPI cards (right of donut): TVR Count (1403), PVR Count (1262), and TVR Spare Count (141) pulled from measures in Measures Table to summarise service requirements vs available spares.
- Allocation summary pivot (left table): lists every route allocation with TVR, PVR, and spare counts so planners can compare requirement vs available fleet at route level.
- Garage summary table (beneath donut): lists garages with their codes, TVR, PVR, and spare values for depot-level planning.
- Vehicle detail grid (right table): vehicle-level listing including fleet number, body type, registration, garage code, allocation, fleet type, and calculated vehicle age for all assets contributing to the PVR/TVR metrics.
- Selected fleet card: echoes the currently active fleet number (Min Fleet No) when filtering the detail grid.
- Page navigator (bottom) matches other tabs for quick navigation.
