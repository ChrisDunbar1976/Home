# Power BI Report Analysis Set Up

**Date:** 2025-09-21

## Context
- Discussed preparing to analyse and replicate an existing Power BI report once the PBIX is available.
- Confirmed .NET SDK is installed; attempted to install pbi-tools via NuGet but network limits prevented using the package source.
- Verified the standalone pbi-tools.core.exe (v1.2.0) works from Installations directory; plan to run it directly.

## Key Decisions
- Store the original PBIX and related assets under Power BI folder for analysis.
- Use the extracted pbi-tools.core.exe instead of a NuGet global tool installation.
- Focus on learning how the report is constructed rather than rebuilding it entirely.

## Next Steps
1. Place the original PBIX in Power BI (add supporting data extracts if needed).
2. Share any visuals or areas that need explanation?screenshots welcome in the same folder.
3. Once the PBIX arrives, run targeted pbi-tools extractions to document complex visuals, queries, and measures.
4. Apply the learnings to the new report with additional requirements, with guided assistance as needed.
