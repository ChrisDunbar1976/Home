# SpendTracker Conversation - Detailed Log

**Date:** August 21, 2025  
**Session:** Google Sheets to Azure SQL Integration Development

## Conversation Flow

### Initial Query
**User:** "I have a Google sheet that I use to maintain my expenditure (ingoings, outgoings, date, spend type, spend item, balance) and so on. I update that on a daily basis. I also have a MS SQL Server (physical instance on my local machine, but am considering moving to Azure). Is it possible to build an API that will poll my Google Sheet (let's call it Spend) on a daily basis and import that data into my MS SQL Server?"

**Assistant Response Summary:** Confirmed feasibility and outlined architecture options including Node.js/Python API, Azure Functions, Windows Service, and Azure Logic Apps. Recommended hybrid approach with push notifications and backup polling.

### Technology Stack Decision
**User:** "On further thought, I will have a SQL Server Azure solution, rather than local machine. I will also use Python. Based on those, what do you advise?"

**Assistant Response:** Recommended Azure Functions with Python for serverless integration, suggesting timer triggers and discussing frequency options beyond daily polling.

### Frequency Requirements
**User:** "I want flexibility. I prefer the implementation stack with Azure functions. Re: a Timer Trigger (daily at specified time), is it possible to poll more regularly? Or even still, have the Google sheets api push any changes to the db?"

**Assistant Response:** Explained various timer frequencies (every minute to custom intervals) and Google Sheets push notification capabilities via Apps Script triggers, Pub/Sub, and webhooks. Recommended hybrid approach with real-time push + backup polling.

### Implementation Request
**User:** "yes, please. My Microsoft credentials are in the folder Projects > RhubarbAccounts > Credentials."

**Assistant Actions Taken:**
- Created todo list with 7 major implementation tasks
- Checked credentials folder structure
- Found Microsoft Credentials.md with login information
- Built complete Azure Functions solution

```

### Key Technical Decisions Made
1. **Timer Frequency:** 15-minute backup sync (configurable via cron)
2. **Authentication:** Secret key validation for webhooks
3. **Data Handling:** Flexible column mapping with upsert operations
4. **Error Handling:** Retry logic with comprehensive logging
5. **Monitoring:** Detailed sync_log table and status endpoints

### Code Highlights

**Google Sheets Client Features:**
- Service account authentication with fallback to environment variables
- Flexible header mapping for various column arrangements
- Robust data parsing with monetary amount handling
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Azure SQL Client Features:**
- Connection management with context managers
- Automatic table creation with proper schemas
- Upsert operations based on sheet row numbers
- Detailed sync attempt logging with performance metrics

**Sync Service Orchestration:**
- Unique sync ID generation for each operation
- Configuration validation before sync attempts
- Execution time tracking and error reporting
- Status monitoring and recent activity retrieval

**Google Apps Script Integration:**
- Debounced change detection (2-second delay)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
- Comprehensive webhook payload with event metadata
- Connection testing and status logging capabilities

### Database Schema
**spend_records table:**
- Primary key with identity column
- Sheet row number tracking for uniqueness
- Flexible data types for various expenditure formats
- Audit trail with created_at/updated_at timestamps

**sync_log table:**
- Complete audit trail of all sync attempts
- Performance metrics and error message storage
- Success/failure tracking by sync type
- Execution time monitoring

## Location Correction
**User:** "Where has that been created? It should be in the RhubarbAccounts folder."

**Assistant Action:** Moved project from `C:\Users\cdunbar\Projects\SpendTracker-AzureFunction` to `C:\Users\cdunbar\Projects\RhubarbAccounts\SpendTracker-AzureFunction` using PowerShell Move-Item command.

## Conversation Preservation Request
**User:** "Please save this conversation in the folder Projects > RhubarbAccounts > Refinement"

**Assistant Action:** Created detailed conversation summary and this comprehensive log in the Refinement folder.

## Final Solution Characteristics

### Sync Options Implemented
- **Real-time:** Google Apps Script onChange/onEdit triggers → webhook → immediate sync
- **Backup:** Timer trigger every 15 minutes for missed changes
- **Manual:** Status endpoint for on-demand sync monitoring
- **Configurable:** Easy timer frequency modification via cron expressions

### Deployment Approach
- **Automated:** PowerShell script creates all Azure resources
- **Configurable:** Environment variables for all credentials and settings
- **Secure:** Key Vault integration for sensitive data storage
- **Monitored:** Application Insights integration for performance tracking

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Retry Logic:** Multiple attempts with exponential backoff
- **Comprehensive Logging:** All operations logged to database and Azure logs
- **Graceful Degradation:** Timer sync continues if webhook fails
- **Validation:** Pre-sync configuration checks to prevent failures

### User Experience Features
- **Status Monitoring:** REST API endpoint for sync health checks
- **Real-time Feedback:** Google Apps Script shows connection test results
- **Detailed Documentation:** Complete setup guides and troubleshooting
- **Local Development:** Full local testing environment with helper scripts

## Technical Specifications

**Python Dependencies:**
- azure-functions (1.18.0)
- google-api-python-client (2.108.0)
